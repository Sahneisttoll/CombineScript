# CombineScript

Created this due to me being lazy switching between Lua Scripts in CSP  
and now i noticed doing all this is actually also long but better in the long run

Combines 3 lua scripts
- Gamepad Force for switching between the 2 Below
- [Akeyroid7 Drift Script](https://twitter.com/Akeyroid7/status/1518070502690271232)
- [Geraint Thomas ACC like Script](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/console-like-controller-gamepadfx.53561/)
